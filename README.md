STEP 1:
Create a new database in MySQL called EBE_LastNameFirstName using your Last name and first name e.g., EBE_GatorAlbert.
You can create the tables described in Step 2 in this database.

STEP 2:
Create the tables as follows:

Write the CREATE statements for the table corresponding to each of the relations. You must decide which data types (and field size, when applicable) will be appropriate for each column in each table.  Each table must have a Primary Key and the appropriate Foreign keys (if applicable).
Write at least two ALTER statements to either add columns or Primary Key or Foreign Key constraints to any of the tables. Do include any columns or constraints that are not in the relational model shown above. HINT: When writing the CREATE statements, leave out the columns or constraints that you will add with the ALTER statements.
Execute all the CREATE and ALTER statements in MySQL.
Optional: If you would like to check that you have created your tables correctly, you can use the DESC command. You do not need to include the DESC queries in your submission.
STEP 3:
Insert data into your tables as follows:

Write one INSERT statement for each of the tables (you may use any dummy data that you can make up).
Execute the INSERT statements in MySQL.  HINT: The order in which you insert data into your tables is important â€“ so pay attention to the Foreign Keys and the referential integrity constraints.
Optional: If you would like to check that you have inserted data into your tables correctly, you can use the SELECT command. You do not need to include the SELECT queries in your submission.
STEP 4:
Create ONE text file with the following SQL statements. .

CREATE DATABASE EBE_LastNameFirstName;
USE DATABASE EBE_LastNameFirstName;
The CREATE, INSERT and ALTER statements you created in Step 2 and Step 3.
